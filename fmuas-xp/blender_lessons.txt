TEXTURE
1 - Make object

2 - UV Unwrap object

3 - Create image texture, lit, and/or normal (png)

4 - Use NODES in Blender to add Image texture to principled BSDF

5 - IGNORE BLENDER MATERIAL (xp only sees image texture)

6 - Use separate textures for glass?

7 - Remove links before adding modifiers and readd before unwrapping


ANIMATION
1 - Start animations at frame 1!

2 - Export root COLLECTION not object

3 - Many datarefs allowed

EXPORTING
1 - Unparent and apply scale to all individually (reset Rx to 0 for ease)

2 - Reverse normals if needed (only half of object shown)
